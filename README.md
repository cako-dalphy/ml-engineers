# Course Project for CML1010 (York University) on the Machine Learning Lifecycle - NLP (Natural Language Processing) Project
In this project we use the movie dataset from Stanford University. A subset of 7000 rows was chosen for the purpose of this assignment to reduce runtime. In the final milestone, the full dataset (25000 rows) was used. 

The project consists of 4 Milestones, in which we go through the machine learning lifecycles. 

PROJECT MILESTONE 1:  Problem, Dataset,  Exploratory Data Analysis

PROJECT MILESTONE 2: Feature  Engineering, Baseline Model, and Interpretability

PROJECT MILESTONE 3:  Machine Learning Implementations

PROJECT MILESTONE 4:  Improvements in Machine Learning Life-cycle
